# Node-XLSX-Writestream

  Simple streaming XLSX writer. Reverse-engineered from sample XLSX files.
  
  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ssafejava/node-xlsx-writestream.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ssafejava/node-xlsx-writestream)

  Node-XLSX-WriteStream is written in [Literate CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/#literate), so the source
  can be viewed as Markdown. 

  [View the source & API.](src/index.litcoffee)

## Usage
  
  You can install the latest version via npm:
  
    $ npm install --save xlsx-writestream

  Require the module:

    var xlsx = require('xlsx-writestream');

  Write a spreadsheet:

    var data = [
        {
            "Name": "Bob",
            "Location": "Sweden"
        },
        {
            "Name": "Alice",
            "Location": "France"
        }
    ];

    xlsx.write('mySpreadsheet.xlsx', data, function (err) {
        // Error handling here
    });

  This will write a spreadsheet like this:

    Name    | Location
    --------+---------
    Bob     | Sweden
    Alice   | France

  In other words: The key names are used for the first row (headers),
  The values are used for the columns. All field names should be present
  in the first row.

## Advanced usage

  You can also use the full API manually. This allows you to build the
  spreadsheet incrementally:

    var XlsxWriter = require('xlsx-writestream');

    var writer = new XlsxWriter('mySpreadsheet.xlsx', {} /* options */);

    // After instantiation, you can grab the readstream at any time.
    writer.getReadStream().pipe(fs.createWriteStream('mySpreadsheet.xlsx'));

    // Add some rows
    writer.addRow({
        "Name": "Bob",
        "Location": "Sweden"
    });
    writer.addRow({
        "Name": "Alice",
        "Location": "France"
    });

    // Add a row with a hyperlink
    writer.addRow({
        "Name": {value: "Bill", hyperlink: "http://www.thegatesnotes.com"},
        "Location": "Seattle, Washington"  
    })

    // Optional: Adjust column widths
    writer.defineColumns([
        { width: 30 }, // width is in 'characters'
        { width: 10 }
    ])

    // Finalize the spreadsheet. If you don't do this, the readstream will not end.
    writer.finalize();

## Data Types
  
  Numbers, Strings, and Dates are automatically converted when inputted. Simply
  use their native types. Additionally, any data item can be turned into a hyperlink
  by enclosing it within an object with the keys `value, hyperlink`.

    writer.addRow({
        "A String Column" : "A String Value",
        "A Number Column" : 12345,
        "A Date Column" : new Date(1999,11,31)
        "A String column with a hyperlink" : {value: "A String Value", hyperlink: "http://www.google.com"}
        "A Number column with a hyperlink" : {value: 12345, hyperlink: "http://www.google.com"}
        "A Date column with a hyperlink" : {value: new Date(1999,11,31), hyperlink: "http://www.google.com"}
    })

## Speed

The XLSX format is actually a zip file, and Node-XLSX-WriteStream uses [node-zip](https://github.com/daraosn/node-zip) internally.
Node-zip generates zip files synchronously but is very fast.

Pending a possible asynchronous rework, if speed is a big concern to you, run `pack()` in 
a thread using something like [node-webworker-threads](https://github.com/audreyt/node-webworker-threads).

This repo contains a simple benchmark suite that can give you an idea of how this module
will perform using a 10x10 and 200x200 dataset. The following are results on an 2.6GHz i7 Mac Mini:

```
Running suite Node-XLSX-WriteStream benchmarks [benchmarks/zip-benchmark.js]...
>> Small dataset (10x10) - Packing x 643 ops/sec ±0.69% (95 runs sampled)
>> Small dataset - Packing (no compression) x 3,057 ops/sec ±1.00% (98 runs sampled)
>> Small dataset - Adding rows x 9,042 ops/sec ±36.26% (32 runs sampled)
>> Small dataset - Generate entire file x 607 ops/sec ±0.79% (95 runs sampled)
>> Large dataset (200x200) - Packing x 2.12 ops/sec ±6.35% (9 runs sampled)
>> Large dataset - Packing (no compression) x 4.29 ops/sec ±10.83% (14 runs sampled)
>> Large dataset - Adding rows x 22.00 ops/sec ±26.83% (41 runs sampled)
>> Large dataset - Generate entire file x 1.89 ops/sec ±9.29% (9 runs sampled)
```

## Contributing

  In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding
  style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality.

  All source-code is written in CoffeeScript and is located in the `src`
  folder. Do not edit the generated files in `lib`, they will get overwritten
  (and aren't included in git anyway).

  You can build and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). The
  default task will clean the source, compiled it and run the tests.
